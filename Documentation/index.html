		<h3 id="intro"><strong>Introduction</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

		<h3>Welcome</h3>

		<p>Firstly, let me thank you for purcashing our latest template. The purpose of this document is to offer you an indepth understanding of how to use the template and fully customise it to your needs.</p>

		<h3>What's Included</h3>

		<p>Included with your purchase are the following files:</p>
 
		<ul>
		    <li>1 HTML page</li>
		    <li>Bootstrap 3.3.7 framework</li>
		    <li>CSS stylesheets</li>
		    <li>Javascript files</li>
		    <li>Images</li>
	    </ul>

		<hr>

		<h3 id="getstarted"><strong>Getting Started</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

		<h3>Installation</h3>

		<p>As this is a purely HTML template, installation couldn't be any easier. To install the template to your website simply upload the contents of the HTML folder to your webserver of choice. This is normally the public_html folder or httpdocs folder. If you aren't sure which folder you need to upload the website to then your webhost should be able to offer you assistance with this.</p>

		<p>There should be a number of folders uploaded to your server for the website to display correctly.</p>

		<p>Firstly, the <b>index.html</b> should be uploaded.</p>

		<p>After this there should be the following folders:</p>

		<ul>
		    <li>CSS stylesheets</li>
		    <li>Javascript files</li>
		    <li>Images folder</li>
		    <li>Fonts folder (optional unless you're going to use Bootstrap's Glyphicons!)</li>
	    </ul>
		<hr>
		<h3>Modifying Files</h3>

		<p>If you'd like to modify any of the files, simply open them up in an editor. If you don't have an editor already, you can download one if you'd like to. Below are two of the popular editors.</p>

		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a></li>
		</ul>

		<p>Once you've download en editor, simply open up the <b>index.html</b> file. That's the main file which is basically the whole theme. You can change anything you want that suits you in this file.</p>

		<p>Opening up the <b>style.css</b> stylesheet will show you the styling of the theme. You can pretty much customize the color, buttons or pictures to your liking. The <b>style.min</b> is the compressed version of the <b>style.css</b>.</p>

		<h3>Bootstrap Framework</h3>

		<p>This template relies on the Twitter Bootstrap framework to remain responsive and work correctly on all sized devices. For more information about the framework please visit the Bootstrap Website - <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Link</a>.</p>

		<p><font color="red">Please note all Bootstrap Javascript Documentation can be also found on Bootstrap's site!</font></p>

		<p>The framework is made up of columns equaling to twelve in width. The basic structure should be as follows as you will see throughout the website code.</p>

		<h3 id="javascript"><strong>Javascript</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

		<p>The theme also uses a file named <b>custom.js</b>. This has all the themes custom scripts in it. Such as the smooth scrolling feature and more. Customize all of it to your liking, the code is well documented so you know what to do.</p>
